# swift-earlgrey-bootcamp

Hello Reader(s). This bootcamp is intended to give you a starting point into the Earlgrey framework and other testing tools for iOS... but truly, it was more of a learning experience for us to create this! 

Here is an alterntive bootcamp if you find our intentions to be vile: [Original Earlgrey Bootcamp] (https://github.com/pivotal-gordon-krull/earlgrey-bootcamp)
